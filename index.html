            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is also defined as the act or process of educating or 
                applying discipline on the mind or a process of character training. It is a dynamic instrument of change. 
                Education is expected to affect or condition the social behaviour of the person being educated. 
                Education is a life-long process which is always used to imply a positive state of mind. 
                Education is the key to turn a weakness into a strength. It offers different tools and ways to understand 
                problems that lay ahead of us and helps resolve them. More importantly, education provides us with considerable 
                mental agility to make the right decisions and spring into action when needed. Many types of research show that educated
                 women can more easily stand up against gender bias and marital violence as they have improved their decision-making capabilities.

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and 
                comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools.
                 Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system, 
                 while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and 
                 non-formal education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, 
                 secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, 
                 like teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education,
                  language education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental 
                states and qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is an essential process in human development. It is different from schooling.
            Schooling is just one of the ways in which education is provided, whereas education deals with the  total process 
            of human learning by which knowledge is imparted, faculties are trained and different skills are developed.
            The benefits of education are many. Not only will you personally benefit from receiving education when it comes to income, 
            career advancement, skill development, and employment opportunities, but your society and community receive benefits of education
             as well.
